**Server-side Rendering :**

- Unlike traditional react app rendering in client-side, next app renders in server-side to improve **SEO** and **Performance**
- In normal react you might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO
- This means First page loads renders through server

3. API routes (for dynamic pages like _/post/1_)
4. static site generation
5. built-in CSS and Sass support
6. easy deployment through github/ bitbucket

# Building Next JS App

> We are going to build next-class simple ðŸ˜‚ blog and the link is [click me witness blog](#building-next-js-app)

Through this learnings we will be using NPM instead of Yarn

## Coding

### Setup

1. NodeJS (latest version don't scold me later ðŸ˜…)
2. create a next-app boiler code folders using cmd `npx create-next-app app-name --use-npm`

To test the app creation use below cmds

```
$ cd app-name
$ npm run dev
```

### Page creation/ Routings

[routes official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)

> So far, we have created only one page app. Now we will try to create many pages and start navigating through them.

- NextJS uses file system based routing, any .js files placed in `pages` folder acts as each webpage
- By default `index.js` file as root page

> pages/index.js â†’ /
>
> pages/blog/first-post.js â†’ /blog/first-post (nested pages)
>
> pages/blog/[slug].js â†’ /blog/:slug (/blog/hello-world)

- Add `anyPageName.js` file in pages folder and access it via [http://localhost:3000/anyPageName](http://localhost:3000/anyPageName)

**Page Linkings**

- In NextJS we use `Link` component from `next/link`

```
    <Link href="/firstPost">
        <a>First Page</a>
    </Link>
```
