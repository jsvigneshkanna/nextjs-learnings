# NextJS-Learnings

Learning Nextjs from different resources and making an sample website. Come lets all learn together ðŸ¤‘

# What is Next JS

- Next JS is frontend React framework built top on react by vercel
- This is popularly used in frontend frameworks over plain react
- Main reason for such popularity is **server-side rendering** and **static page generation**
- Next JS gives better developer experience in form [pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/)

**Server-side Rendering :**

- Unlike traditional react app rendering in client-side, next app renders in server-side to improve **SEO** and **Performance**
- In normal react you might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO
- This means First page loads renders through server

**Features :**

1. SPA aplicable
2. Easy and dynamic [routings](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) through page folder
3. API routes (for dynamic pages like _/post/1_)
4. static site generation
5. built-in CSS and Sass support
6. easy deployment through github/ bitbucket

# Building Next JS App

> We are going to build next-class simple ðŸ˜‚ blog and the link is [click me witness blog](#building-next-js-app)

Through this learnings we will be using NPM instead of Yarn

## Coding

### Setup

1. NodeJS (latest version don't scold me later ðŸ˜…)
2. create a next-app boiler code folders using cmd `npx create-next-app app-name --use-npm`

To test the app creation use below cmds

```
$ cd app-name
$ npm run dev
```

### Page creation/ Routings

[routes official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)

> So far, we have created only one page app. Now we will try to create many pages and start navigating through them.

- NextJS uses file system based routing, any .js files placed in `pages` folder acts as each webpage
- By default `index.js` file as root page

> pages/index.js â†’ /
>
> pages/blog/first-post.js â†’ /blog/first-post (nested pages)
>
> pages/blog/[slug].js â†’ /blog/:slug (/blog/hello-world)

- Add `anyPageName.js` file in pages folder and access it via [http://localhost:3000/anyPageName](http://localhost:3000/anyPageName)

### Page Linkings

Links are used to make client side navigation rather than page reload from server-side

- In NextJS we use `Link` component from `next/link`

```
    <Link href="/firstPost">
        <a>First Page</a>
    </Link>
```

### Assets, Metadata, and CSS

1. **Assets :**

   - Assets like images, favicons which public users can access, will be stored in **/public** folder
   - We can use [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) to extend new features which `img` tag has
   - Images are lazy loaded by default. That means your page speed isn't penalized for images outside the viewport. Images load as they are scrolled into viewport.
     > When using `Image`, we need to specify height and width props

2. **Metadata :**

   - We can add metadata related to the individual page(pageName.js), or as whole website(app.js)
   - NextJS uses `Head` tag from `next/head` instead of `head` tag in html

     ```
     import Head from 'next/head'
     <Head>
         <title>Create Next App</title>
         <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
     </Head>
     ```

   - To use 3rd party js script we use `Script` tag from `next/script` instead of traditional `<script>` to optimize the js file loadings and performance
     ```
     import Script from 'next/script'
     <Script
     src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"
     strategy="lazyOnload"
     onLoad={() =>
       console.log(`script loaded correctly, window.FB has been populated`)
     }
     />
     ```
